# Pipeline Of Our project:

## Task 1:
# FreqNet and ResNet Architecture

This repository implements a hybrid architecture combining spatial and frequency domain processing for image forgery detection. It integrates *FreqNet* for frequency-domain feature extraction, *Wavelet Attention* mechanisms, and a *ResNet-inspired backbone* for robust spatial feature extraction.

## Architecture Overview

1. *Input Processing*
   - Transforms the RGB input image into the frequency domain using *FFT*.
   - Suppresses low-frequency components, enhancing high-frequency details.
   - Converts the frequency domain back to the spatial domain using *iFFT*.

2. *FreqNet*
   - Alternates between *HFRFSBlock* and *FCLBlock* for frequency-based feature extraction.
   - Uses *stride-2 convolutions* to reduce dimensions.

3. *Wavelet Attention*
   - Applies *Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT)* for multi-scale feature extraction.
   - Enhances important high-frequency regions using a *softmax-based attention* mechanism.

4. *ResNet-Inspired Backbone*
   - Uses residual blocks with convolution layers (1x1, 3x3) for spatial feature extraction.
   - Applies *wavelet attention* in deeper layers for enriched multi-scale representation.

5. *Feature Aggregation & Classification*
   - *Adaptive average pooling* reduces spatial dimensions.
   - A *fully connected layer* performs binary classification.
# Task 2: Vision-Language Model (VLM) for Explanation Generation

The Task 2 pipeline generates explanations for images detected as fake by the Task 1 pipeline. Below is an overview of the pipeline steps:

## Pipeline Overview

1. *Input Image*: An image identified as fake by Task 1 is passed into Task 2.
2. *CLIP Model: The image is processed through the **CLIP* model to extract relevant artifacts associated with the image.
3. *Idefics2 Model: The extracted artifacts and the image are input into the pretrained **Idefics2* model.
4. *Explanation Generation: **Idefics2* generates detailed explanations, outlining why the image is detected as fake.

## Pre-trained Models and Setup

- *CLIP Model*: Used for extracting relevant artifacts associated with the input image.
- *Idefics2 Model*: A pretrained model for generating explanations based on the image and its corresponding artifacts.

## Evaluation and Logging

- *Evaluation Steps*: Evaluations are conducted every 10 steps.
- *Logging Steps*: Logs are generated every 5 steps to monitor the process.
- *Checkpoint Management*: Checkpoint saving is limited to ensure efficiency.
